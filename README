This is the Berlin clock, scala test

This is a scala project built using SBT in java 1.8 in the Intellij IDE

This code will compile down to an executable jar by running 'sbt assembly'. The jar file will be located at target/scala-2.10/berlinClock.jar

The Berlin clock program will ask you for 3 inputs, an hour, minute, and second. All of these inputs should be integers.
Hour has a range from 0 to 23
Minute and Second have a range of 0 to 59
Or, if you like, you can type in 'now' (case sensitive) when asked for the Hour to use the current time.

After the program has all the information it needs, it will display what the Berlin clock would look like at that given time.
